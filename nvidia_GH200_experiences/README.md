## Experiences with the NVIDIA Grace Hopper architecture in HPC systems

The NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip combines the NVIDIA Grace and Hopper architectures into a single CPU+GPU coherent memory model, with the ability to greatly accelerate data-intensive GPU workflows. A number of RMACC institutions recently acquired GH200 nodes. This thirty-minute "Birds of a Feather" will enable participants to discuss their early experiences with the GH200, or to learn from others' experiences if they are considering the Grace Hopper architecture.

The first 30 minutes will focus on user-facing aspects while the second 30 minutes will focus on system facing aspects.
