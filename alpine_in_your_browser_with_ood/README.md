Do you want to use Alpine to easily run graphical applications, transfer data, and submit jobs, all from your browser? Open OnDemand is a browser based interactive tool that provides access to CU Research Computing (CURC) resources (such as Alpine and Blanca). It is the primary method that allows institutions in RMACC to access CURC resources and is also extremely useful for any individual who is new to High Performance Computing systems.

In this course, we will cover logging in, performing small data transfers, accessing a login node, and starting interactive applications (such as Jupyter) all via Open OnDemand. Additionally, we will demonstrate how to use common graphical applications, such as Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio.
